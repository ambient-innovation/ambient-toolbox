# Migration from "ai_django_core"

This package was previously known as [ai_django_core](https://pypi.org/project/ai-django-core/). Due to the
misleading nature of the name, we chose to rename it with something more meaningful.

The migration is really simple, just:

* Install ambient-toolbox and remove the dependency to ai-django-core
* Search and replace all usages of `from ai_django_core...` to `from ambient_toolbox...`
* The class-based mail functionality was moved to a separate package called
[django-pony-express](https://pypi.org/project/django-pony-express/).

## Installation

- Install the package via pip:

  `pip install ambient-toolbox`

  or via pipenv:

  `pipenv install ambient-toolbox`

- Add module to `INSTALLED_APPS` within the main django `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    "ambient_toolbox",
)
```

- Apply migrations by running:

  `python ./manage.py migrate`

### Publish to ReadTheDocs.io

  up.

### Publish to PyPi

- Update documentation about new/changed functionality

- Update the `Changelog`

- Increment version in main `__init__.py`

- Create pull request / merge to master

- This project uses the flit package to publish to PyPI. Thus, publishing should be as easy as running:
  ```
  flit publish
  ```

  To publish to TestPyPI use the following to ensure that you have set up your .pypirc as
  shown [here](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upload.html#using-pypirc) and use the following command:

  ```
  flit publish --repository testpypi
  ```

### Maintenance

Please note that this package supports the [ambient-package-update](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/).
So you don't have to worry about the maintenance of this package. This updater is rendering all important
configuration and setup files. It works similar to well-known updaters like `pyupgrade` or `django-upgrade`.

To run an update, refer to the [documentation page](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/)
of the "ambient-package-update".
